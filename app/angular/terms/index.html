    Promoter does not create an employer/employee relationship, partnership, or joint venture between EverFit and

<p class="p4">A corporation, limited liability company, partnership or trust (collectively referred to as a
    “Business Entity”) may apply to be an EverFit Promoter by submitting a properly completed Promoter Application
    &amp; Promoter Agreement. It is the responsibility of the Business Entity to have its own bylaws or operating
    agreement to govern the rights and relationship between the participants. The following rules apply to all
    Business Entities:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p4">•<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The Promoter Agreement must be signed by all of the
    shareholders, members, partners, trustees or any person holding an ownership interest or management position in
    the Business Entity (collectively “Participants”). If there are more than one Participants of the Business
    Entity so that an online agreement is not possible, a physical agreement must be completed by request of
    EverFit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Participants are jointly and severally liable for any
    indebtedness or other obligations to EverFit.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">•<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>An EverFit Promoter operating his or her business as a sole
    proprietorship may change the form of her business to a partnership, limited liability company, corporation or
    trust, or from one type of entity to another so long as the original EverFit Promoter remains the Contact Person
    for the Business Entity. A $100.00 change fee will be charged for each entity change.<span
            class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p4">•<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The conduct of any Participant is imputed to the Business
    Entity as a whole. Therefore, if any one Participant violates the Promoter Agreement or EverFit’s Policies and
    Procedures, the misconduct of that Participant shall be imputed to the Business Entity.<span

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p4">• The Contact Person may, with consent of the Participant(s), operate the EverFit business pursuant to
    an assignment in writing whereby the relinquishing Participants authorize EverFit to deal directly and solely
    with the Contact Person. All commissions, recognition and other remuneration and rewards will be issued in the
    name of the Contact Person.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p4">• The Participants may continue to operate the EverFit business jointly on a “business-as-usual”
    basis, whereupon all compensation paid by EverFit will be paid according to the status quo as it existed prior
    to the dissolution proceedings. This is the default procedure if the parties do not agree on the format set
    forth above.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p4">•, Under no circumstances will EverFit split commission or bonus checks between Participants in

    this personal relationship remains intact, EverFit Promoters may not sell, assign, or otherwise transfer an
    EverFit business to any third party. Any attempt to sell, assign or otherwise transfer to a third party will
    terminate the Promoter’s Agreement.</p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p4">2.8. SUCCESSION – INHERITANCE OR INCAPACITATION<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">Upon the death or legally adjudicated incapacitation of an EverFit<span

<p class="p4">• The Business(es) each must be a bona fide independent business that is operated by the person listed
    on the EverFit Promoter Application and Promoter Agreement and not by the owner of the other Business. An
    “Immediate Household” includes spouses, cohabitating couples, and children over the age of 18 and relatives
    residing in the same dwelling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Also included in the definition are

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p4">An EverFit Promoter may only submit ideas and/or material to EverFit if he or she has obtained
    appropriate copyright and other permission to submit such materials, and permits EverFit to use such material

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p4">3.7. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">EverFit Promoters are free to participate in other business ventures or marketing opportunities except
    as set forth below:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">1.<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Promoters may not have their own website where
    fitness-related products or services are shown, promoted or sold.</p>

<p class="p4">2.<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Promoters may not participate in any program, product,
    service business opportunity or website of a fitness-related or similar company in the same generic product or
    service categories as offered by EverFit, regardless of cost differences, quality or other distinguishing
    factors unless approved in writing by Live EverFit, LLC.</p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p4">3.7.1. OTHER SELLING ACTIVITIES<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">EverFit Promoters may engage in other business ventures, including selling activities related to
    non-EverFit products, services or business opportunities if they desire to do so, but they may not take
    advantage of their knowledge of, or association with, other EverFit Promoters whom they did not personally
    sponsor in order to promote or sell such non-EverFit products, services or opportunities. In addition, EverFit
    Promoters shall not offer any non-EverFit products, services, incentives, opportunities or business plans in
    conjunction with EverFit’s products or business plan or at any EverFit conference call, meeting, seminar,
    launch, convention or other EverFit function. However, nothing in this Section 3.7.1 restricts a EverFit
    Promoter regularly engaged in the operation of appointment-based professional services (e.g. law, medicine,
    dentistry, accounting, salons) from serving customers who are EverFit Clients and who have sought them out.<span
            class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p4">3.7.2. CROSS-COMPANY ENTICEMENT<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">During the term of an EverFit Promoter’s Agreement and all renewals thereof, and for a period of one
    year after termination, cancellation or expiration of the EverFit Promoter’s Agreement for any reason, each
    EverFit Promoter shall not encourage or attempt to influence or induce an EverFit Promoter to cancel or alter
    his or her relationship with EverFit. Such conduct constitutes an unwarranted and unreasonable interference with
    the business of other EverFit Promoter and EverFit.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p4">In addition, if an EverFit Promoter appears in, is referenced in, or allows his or her name or
    likeness to be featured or referenced in any promotional, recruiting or solicitation materials for another
    Fitness or fitness-related company during the term of the EverFit Promoter’s Agreement and all renewals thereof,
    this shall constitute Enticement for purposes of this Section 3.7.2.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
</p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p4">Further, if EverFit determines that a EverFit Promoter is participating in any program, product,
    service or business opportunity of another fitness Fitness-related company in the same generic product or
    service categories as offered by EverFit, regardless of cost differences, quality or other distinguishing
    factors, then EverFit may immediately revoke the EverFit Promoter’s status and terminate the Agreement with the
    Promoter.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p4">The provisions of this Section 3.7 shall survive the termination, cancellation or expiration of the

    information of EverFit, and constitute a business trade secret belonging to EverFit. These Reports contain
    critical data relating to the identities of EverFit Promoters, Clients, sales information and sponsoring
    activity of each EverFit Promoter. They are provided to EverFit Promoter by EverFit in strictest confidence and
    are made available to EverFit Promoters for the sole purpose of supporting their Clients and the EverFit
    Promoters to further develop their EverFit business. Every EverFit Promoter who is provided such information
    must treat it as confidential and take care to maintain its secrecy and refrain from making any use thereof for
    any purpose other than the management of his EverFit business.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p4">As a result of your position as a EverFit Promoter, you will have access to confidential information

    further build and promote your EverFit business.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p4">The EverFit Promoter and EverFit agree that, but for this agreement of confidentiality and
    nondisclosure, EverFit would not provide these Reports or other EverFit confidential information to the EverFit
    Promoter. During any term of the Agreement, and for a period of two years after the termination or expiration of
    the Promoter Agreement between the EverFit Promoter and EverFit, for any reason whatsoever, the EverFit Promoter
    shall not, on his or her own behalf, or on behalf of any other person, partnership, association, corporation or
    other entity:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p4">The provisions of this Section 3.8 shall survive the termination, cancellation or expiration of the
    Promoter Agreement.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">3.9. REMEDIES FOR DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND VIOLATION OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST<span
        class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">Each EverFit Promoter acknowledges that EverFit would suffer irreparable harm as a result of any
    unauthorized disclosure or use of EverFit’s confidential information, including any Reports, or recruitment or
    solicitation of EverFit Promoters for another fitness-related company in violation of Sections 3.7 and 3.8, and
    that monetary damages are insufficient to compensate EverFit for such harm. Therefore, if any EverFit Promoter
    is in breach of these Sections, EverFit is entitled to an injunction or temporary restraining order, without
    notice to such EverFit Promoter, restraining any unauthorized disclosure or use of the confidential information
    or any recruiting or soliciting in violation of Sections 3.7 or 3.8 in addition to any other available remedy,
    including damages. In any such action, if EverFit prevails, each EverFit Promoter agrees that he or she will
    reimburse EverFit for its costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in connection with taking the legal
    action. As to EverFit, EverFit Promoters waive all bonding requirements otherwise applicable to a temporary
    restraining order and/or injunction.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">If any member of an EverFit Promoter’s Immediate Household engages in any activity which, if performed

    action pursuant to the Policies &amp; Procedures against the EverFit Promoter. Similarly, if any individual

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p4">All disciplinary sanctions are in addition to EverFit’s right to terminate or cancel the Promoter

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p4">SECTION 10 – INACTIVITY AND CANCELLATION<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p4">10.1. EFFECT OF SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">An EverFit Promoter’s bonuses and commissions constitute the entire consideration for the EverFit
    Promoter’s efforts in generating sales and all activities related to generating sales. Following an EverFit
    Promoter’s non-renewal of his or her Agreement, cancellation of the Agreement for inactivity, or voluntary
    cancellation or involuntary termination of the Agreement (all of these methods are collectively referred to as
    “termination”), An EverFit Promoter whose business is terminated will lose all rights as an EverFit Promoter and
    his or her EverFit business will be canceled. This includes, but is not limited to, loss of the right to sell
    EverFit products and services, to participate in EverFit’s functions or events, and to receive future
    commissions, bonuses, awards or other income resulting from the sales. Terminated EverFit Promoters have no
    right to compensation or damages from EverFit. In the event of termination, Promoters agree to waive all rights
    they may have, including but not limited to any bonuses, commissions or other remuneration derived from the
    sales after the date of the activities causing such termination.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p4">Suspended EverFit Promoters are not permitted to attend EverFit functions, engage in any EverFit
    related activities, recruit EverFit Promoters, or sell EverFit products so long as the suspension remains in
    effect, nor are they eligible to participate in EverFit’s compensation plan or receive commissions from EverFit
    while the suspension is in effect. If an EverFit Promoter’s Agreement is terminated following a suspension, the
    termination date is retroactive to the date of suspension, and the former EverFit Promoter shall have no right
    to recover commissions held during the suspension period. If EverFit determines that it is appropriate to
    reinstate a suspended<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">EverFit Promoter, EverFit may, at its discretion, impose disciplinary sanctions as set forth in these
    Policies &amp; Procedures as a condition of reinstating the suspended EverFit Promoter.<span
            class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p4">When termination occurs for any reason, an EverFit Promoter must wait 12 calendar months from the date
    of termination before reapplying as an EverFit Promoter. It is left to EverFit’s discretion whether to accept
    any individual who has previously been terminated. Suspension and termination are retroactive to the beginning
    of the calendar month in which the alleged wrongful conduct occurred for which the suspension is imposed by
    EverFit.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p4">In addition to the indemnification obligations set forth in these Policies &amp; Procedures, an
    EverFit Promoter who is involuntarily terminated for violation of the Agreement, or who voluntarily terminates
    his or her Agreement to avoid an involuntary termination or other disciplinary sanction, shall, upon demand by
    EverFit, be liable to repay, return or compensate EverFit for any benefit programs, prizes, incentives,
    commissions, bonuses or other remuneration received from EverFit after the date of the activities causing such
    termination, as well as any other damages resulting to EverFit from such conduct.<span
            class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p4">10.2. CANCELLATION FOR INACTIVITY<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">If a EverFit Promoter has not renewed and has been inactive (no personal purchases or sales) during a
    12 consecutive calendar month period, he or she will be cancelled as an EverFit Promoter on the first business
    day of the 13th month of inactivity. At this time, all rights are relinquished. After cancellation has occurred
    in the 13th month, he or she will be eligible to submit a new Promoter Application, under the sponsor of their
    choice, and a new EverFit ID will be issued.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p4">10.3. AGREEMENT TERMINABLE AT WILL<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">An EverFit Promoter may terminate his or her relationship with EverFit at any time by providing a
    signed written notice to EverFit. EverFit may also terminate the relationship with an EverFit Promoter
    (including any partnerships, corporations or other entity) at any time by providing written notice.<span
            class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p4">EverFit Promoters or EverFit are not required to have any reason, nor do EverFit Promoters or EverFit
    have to claim or prove any cause to terminate this relationship. A termination will be effective after the
    terminating party sends to the other, by Certified Mail, Return Receipt Requested, or UPS, FedEx, etc. a written
    notice of intent to terminate at the expiration of Thirty (30) days from the date upon which such notice is
    mailed to the other. Such termination will then occur at the end of the Thirty (30) day notice period.<span
            class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall be able to
    terminate such agreements immediately, without the sending of the aforesaid written Thirty (30) day notice, upon
    the death or bankruptcy of a sales representative or promoter, or in the event of a breach of an agreement.<span
            class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p4">If and when the relationship is terminated, EverFit Promoters shall have no claim against EverFit nor
    any right to claim or collect lost profits, lost opportunities or any other damages. Termination will result in
    the loss of all benefits as an EverFit Promoter.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p4">If an EverFit Promoter’s relationship with EverFit is terminated, he or she may not re-enroll in
    EverFit under a new Sponsor until 12 calendar months have elapsed from the date on which the relationship was
    terminated or the date on which the EverFit Promoter placed his or her last order with EverFit, whichever is
    later. EverFit reserves the right to reject any re-enrollment application. EverFit makes no promises or
    assurances that the relationship with any EverFit Promoter will continue for any period or term.<span

    jurisdiction in the county and state of the EverFit corporate office in the United States, or in any other
    jurisdiction as necessary to enforce an arbitration award or the injunctive relief granted by a court, or to
    seek a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction to ensure that the relief sought in arbitration is
    not rendered ineffectual during the pendency of, or after the rendition of, a decision in any arbitration
    proceeding. The institution of any action for equitable relief or to enforce an award or order shall not
    constitute a waiver of the right or obligation of any party to submit any claim seeking relief other than
    injunctive or enforcement relief to arbitration. Judgment upon the award may be entered by the United States
    District Court or state trial court located in the county and state of the EverFit corporate office in the
    United States, or application may be made to such court for the judicial acceptance of the award and order of
    enforcement, as the case may be, if the arbitrator’s award or decision is not complied with within seven days of
    the arbitrator’s decision.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

    predicated on the Promoter Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a defense to EverFit’s enforcement of an
    EverFit Promoter’s covenants and agreements contained herein or under the Agreement. This agreement to arbitrate
    shall survive any termination or expiration of any other agreements between the parties.<span

    products or services, unless agreed to by EverFit in writing.</p>

<p class="p4">2. I agree that as an EverFit Promoter, I am an independent contractor, and not an employee, agent,
    partner, legal representative, or franchisee of EverFit. I shall be solely responsible for paying all expenses
    incurred by myself, including but not limited to travel, food, lodging, secretarial, office, long distance

    and made a part of these Terms and Conditions (collectively referred to as the “Agreement”). I understand that I
    must be in good standing, and not in violation of any of the terms of the Agreement, to be eligible to receive
    remuneration from EverFit. EverFit may amend its Policies and Procedures at its sole discretion.<span

    is canceled or terminated for any reason, I will permanently lose all rights as a EverFit Promoter and I shall
    not be eligible to sell EverFit products and services. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">6. I<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>agree, warrant and represent that I will keep
    confidential, both during the term of this Agreement and forever after its termination, all information obtained
    from EverFit with respect to all trade secrets, proprietary matters, business procedures, customer lists, needs

    whatsoever. EverFit shall be entitled to an injunction restraining me from disclosing this information in the
    event of a breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this paragraph.</p>

<p class="p4">7. I may not assign any rights or delegate my duties under this Agreement without the prior written
    consent of EverFit. Any attempt to sell, assign or transfer this Agreement terminates this Agreement and results
    in the termination of my EverFit business.</p>

<p class="p4">8. I understand that if I fail to comply with the terms of the Agreement, EverFit may, at its
    discretion impose upon me disciplinary sanctions as set forth in the Policies and Procedures. If I am in breach,
    default or violation of this Agreement at termination, I shall not be entitled to receive any further bonuses or
    commissions, whether or not the sales for such bonuses or commissions have been completed.</p>

    referred to as “affiliates”), shall not be liable for, and I waive all claims to, consequential and exemplary
    damages against EverFit and its affiliates. I further agree to release EverFit and its affiliates from all
    liability arising from or relating to the promotion or operation of my EverFit business and any activities
    related to it (e.g., the presentation of EverFit products or the operation of a motor vehicle, etc.), and I
    agree to indemnify EverFit and its affiliates for any liability, damages, fines, penalties, or other awards
    arising from any unauthorized conduct that I undertake in operating my business.</p>

    entire contract between EverFit and myself. Any promises, representations, offers, or other communications not
    expressly set forth in this Agreement are of no force or effect.</p>

<p class="p4">11. Any waiver by EverFit of any breach of this Agreement must be in writing and signed by an
    authorized officer of EverFit. Waiver by EverFit of any breach of this Agreement by me shall not operate or be
    construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach.</p>

<p class="p4">12. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be
    reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable, and the balance of the Agreement will remain in
    full force and effect.</p>

<p class="p4">13. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas
    without regard to principles of conflicts of laws. All disputes and claims relating to or arising from the
    Agreement, the rights and obligations of an EverFit Promoter, or any other claims or causes of action relating
    to the performance of either a EverFit Promoter or EverFit under the Agreement shall be settled as specified in
    EverFit’s Mediation and Arbitration Policy contained in the Policies and Procedures. <span

    omission relating to or arising from this Agreement, such action must be brought within one year from the date
    of the alleged conduct giving rise to the cause of action. Failure to bring such action within such time shall

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">As a Fitness Trainer/Promoter, what can Ever Fit™ do for you?:</span></p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p4">Ever Fit’s goal is simply to bring Clients and Trainers together in a unique and rewarding way. We are
    going to reach potential training clients by offering fitness videos of all types, LIVE online fitness classes
    and the equipment/nutrition tools necessary to go along with the personal training all on one easy to use
    fitness website. By providing all of this for multiple types of training and through multiple different
    trainers, we can help many more individuals reach their fitness goals together than we could ever do on our
    own.</p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p4">In addition to helping these individuals with their personal fitness, our goal is to reward fitness
    Trainers/Promoters for their vital role by providing passive income through the continuous sale of all our
    fitness supplements, food, clothing, music, equipment and LIVE fitness classes.<span
            class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>From your first day with EverFit™ you can begin to earn income.

    base, the EverFit™ Success Plan offers you lucrative and non-complex reward structure. The rewards include:
    Multiple Sales Commissions, cash bonuses and annual “Top Producer” Trips at the most luxurious locations around
    the world!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p4">LiveEverFit.com can help both Trainers and Clients who are looking for Quality Training and Fitness
    Products in a way that no one has done before—through one truly all-inclusive fitness network website.<span
            class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>EverFit™ is the “one stop shop” for your clientele
    featuring:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

    </li>
</ul>
<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p4">LiveEverFit.com will provide Trainers:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li4">o<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Increased monthly income from online product sales,
        giving you a higher income while working fewer hours each day.
    </li>
    <li class="li4">o<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Increased flexibility to work online when your schedule
        allows, giving you more of a personal life.
    </li>
    <li class="li4">o<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Increased Online presence through a nation-wide,
        branded website that empowers you through:
    </li>
    <li class="li4">o<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>A Training Network, advertising together for a common
        goal.
    </li>
    <li class="li4">o<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>A storefront stocked with over 1000 pieces of fitness
        products.
    </li>
    <li class="li4">o<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>A professional line of clothing that was designed by
        Trainers for themselves and their Clients.
    </li>
    <li class="li4">o<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Music produced by global DJ’s that will keep you and
        your clients moving.
    </li>
</ul>
<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p4">I have spoken with many Trainers who currently have their own training website and many of them have
    the same issues:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
    <ul class="ul1">
        <li class="li4">o<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>It’s a great way to diversify the time available in
            each day to generate addition income, but trying to create a nationally recognized brand is very
            expensive and near impossible for one trainer to do on their own. Most of the Trainer’s branded clothing
            line ends up being a T-shirt with a logo on it, which was cool for a couple weeks; then became a
            headache and not worth the effort over time.
        </li>
        <li class="li4">o<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>A typical individual Trainer’s site will never be
            seen by the vast majority of potential Clients that are looking for a Personal Trainer and an
            all-inclusive training website. With thousands of training websites it’s easy for most of these
            individual sites to become lost within the worldwide sea of fitness and training sites. By combining the
            marketability of these individual sites into one singular marketing force along with a complete fitness
            storefront, EverFit™ will become a nationally recognized brand very quickly.
        </li>
        <li class="li4">o<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Daily maintenance of a website can be more time
            consuming and costly than initially anticipated. Very often their website ends up being outdated and
            unproductive in general.
        </li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p4">By providing all of the upfront and continual maintenance costs for the website as well as a
    storefront, LiveEverFit.com allows the Trainers to concentrate on what they do best—training their Clients. Our
    goal is to maximize each Trainer’s income potential. With our help, Trainers can make an unlimited amount of
    passive income through commissions paid from product sales on the LiveEverfit.com website. This, in addition to
    our global advertising, will ensure that LiveEverFit.com becomes a mainstream website, not just another
    individual training site.</p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">Trainer’s Compensation:</p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p4">The tools LiveEverFit.com provides will help each Trainer with personal promotion by giving them a
    professional brand to represent and the marketing tools to allow an unlimited second income stream through
    online sales. This will truly maximize each Personal Trainer’s income potential through:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
    <ul class="ul1">
        <li class="li4">o<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>online purchases of fitness products by Basic
            Subscribers
        </li>
        <li class="li4">o<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>individual online Clients who have become Level 2,
            3 and 4 Subscribers
        </li>
        <li class="li4">o<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>in-person training sales from the Subscribers who
            live in your area
        </li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p4">Each Trainer will receive monthly commissions for online sales and from Level 2, 3 and 4 Subscribers
    as soon as their videos are posted on the website and as long as they maintain active training status.<span
            class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Basic Subscribers will not have access to the Trainer’s personal
    contact information.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each subscriber will have the option to have
    direct communication with the Trainer of their choice, once per month, in order to have fitness
    routines/nutrition customized to their needs or goals by upgrading their Basic Subscription to Level 2
    Subscription for $45 per month.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each subscriber can also upgrade to
    a Level 3 subscription for $350 per month in order to get one on one customized diet and exercise training two
    times per week or a Level 4 subscription for $500 per month to get full on Contest Prep coaching.<span
            class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition, IF a Level 2, 3 or 3 subscriber wants to be trained
    in person, EverFit does not ask for any of that income, so 100% of that income is the Trainer’s to keep as
    additional incentive to promote our online products and services.</p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p4">To be an active Trainer there must be (5) completed videos uploaded to the Trainers blog inside the
    EverFit™ website.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>See Terms and Conditions for video timeline and
    structure requirements.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To remain an Active Trainer once the videos
    are loaded your total sales must be at least $100 per month and you must renew you membership annually for
    $15.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Every trainer I have spoken to says that just one of their
    clients could spend easily 2x this amount monthly, so this should not serve as a deterrent to anyone serious
    about the opportunity.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p4">Passive income generators:</p>

<p class="p6">1)<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Active Trainers will receive (5%) commission on all “Forever
    Fit” clothing, Equipment, Supplements, music and LIVE class sales.</p>

<p class="p6">2)<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Active Trainers will receive $25 per month from every Level
    2 Subscribers that they are providing individual online training/nutrition programs for.</p>

    Promoter based on exceeding sales goals.</p>

<p class="p6">6)<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Active Trainers have the opportunity to acquire retail sales
    for our EverFit™ clothing line, for which a 5% sales commission would be paid for all orders.<span

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p4">Income Example:</p>

<p class="p4">Let me give you an example that I was given from one of our existing Trainers to help you calculate
    what personal income is possible through BeForeverFit.com:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
    <ul class="ul1">
        <li class="li4">o<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>How many individuals are you currently training and
            how many Facebook friends and followers do you have?
        </li>
        <li class="li4">o<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>What percentage of these individuals could you get
            to purchase their supplements/equipment/clothing/workout music from BeForeverFit.com? (Remember they are
            already spending this money. You simply need to direct them to our quality products.)
        </li>
        <li class="li4">o<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>What do you think is the average amount of money
            each of these individuals spends a month on all of these items?
        </li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p4">Now to help you work the math:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
    <ul class="ul1">
        <li class="li4">o<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Take the number of people you think you can bring
            to BeForeverFit.com from your immediate network
        </li>
        <li class="li4">o<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Multiply that by what you think they spend on
            average each month
        </li>
        <li class="li4">o<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Multiply that number by your commission of 5%</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p class="p4">What you get is just the beginning of what you could be making each month as passive income for simply
    recording a few videos<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and maintaining a blog, which many of you are
    doing already. I hope that you would like to receive a check every month for the number you came up with and
    will join me in making BeForeverFit.com the largest and most inclusive fitness network on the web. We will
    surely succeed more by riding the large wave we all create together.</p>

            class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p4">Most Common Questions Answered:</p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p4">1)<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>How are my commissions calculated?</p>

<p class="p4">Any individual Trainer can sign up an unlimited number of Clients. Upon signup every Client (now a
    Subscriber) is asked: “Who brought you to the LiveEverFit.com website?” They cannot join without answering this
    question. Once the Subscriber has selected a Trainer, they will be assigned to that Trainer for as long as they
    are a member of BeForeverFit.com and that Trainer will get commissions for all of the sales purchased from the
    website by that Subscriber.</p>

<p class="p4">Once the Client becomes a Subscriber, they will get unlimited access to the entire video library and
    the entire LiveEverFit.com website. The potential for unlimited income is based on how well each Trainer
    promotes themselves and the products available on our site. It is truly limitless because unlike doing a website
    on your own, LiveEverFit.com has power in group marketing and the ability to generate far more Clients for each
    Trainer because of our large online presence.</p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p4">2)<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>What if I already have a supplement deal or non-compete?</p>

<p class="p4">I have personally spoken with the owners of one of the largest supplement companies in the country
    about this issue and there is no violation of your contract by joining LiveEverFit.com. We are presenting all of
    the top supplements for our Trainers to promote in a completely unbiased manner. Due to the variety of trainers
    we need to have a variety of products. As long as the individual Trainer who has the supplement agreement only
    promotes that supplement on their LiveEverFit.com blog, there is no violation of the contract.<span
            class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is not different than representing a brand that is sold in a
    supermarket.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just because the supermarket is selling other brands
    does not mean the Promoter/Trainer is violating their commitment.</p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p4">3)<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>What if my Gym thinks it is a violation of our contract?</p>

<p class="p5"><br></p>

<p class="p4">LiveEverFit.com is not in competition with any gym. We are marketing to those people who want to
    increase their personal level of fitness. These are the same people targeted by gyms. Giving the gym’s Trainers
    additional marketing exposure to these potential Clients will do nothing but add to the gym’s marketing exposure
    for FREE. All of the Subscribers who are looking for in-person training and find a Trainer they love through
    LiveEverFit.com will have to join a gym; and they are going to join the gym where the Trainer is already
    training. That is a complete win-win-win for the Client, Trainer, Gym and LiveEverFit.com.</p>
