        <h1>How does the Rewards Program work for me?</h1>
        <ol style="font-size: 16px;">
            <li>
                Purchases: At EverFit™ we truly want you to make the most of being part of the team through our
                <span class="ever-blue">Stack and Rack Your Weights</span> program. 1 pound will be stacked to your
                barbell
                for every $1 you spend in our store, just like many credit cards. Keep stacking the pounds and use them
                as
                store credit towards ANY merchandise you want! FREE stuff!
            </li>
            <li>
                Affiliate program: As a User/Fanatic, you automatically get points/pounds from your own purchases, which
                is awesome. But in addition, you can earn additional points simply by telling other people about EverFit
                through your AFFILATE link! Your affiliate link can be shared on all social media accounts, email, text
                or
                any other electronic means of distribution. A new user does not have to be someone you know personally.
                Your
                affiliate link will bring them to the website and at the same time code them to your name so that you
                receive additional “Pounds” on YOUR barbell from THEIR purchases. That means that if some person clicks
                your
                link, who you may or may not know, and then purchased an item from the EverFit store, you get FREE
                Pounds
                that YOU can redeem as store credit. Yes, it is that simple!
